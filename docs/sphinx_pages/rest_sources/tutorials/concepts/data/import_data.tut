Importing Data
==============

Shark provides a number of containers for data storage.
Read the basic :ref:`data tutorials <label_for_data_tutorials>`
first if you are not familiar with these containers. This tutorial
deals with how to fill the containers with actual data.

For the examples in this tutorial we need the following includes: ::

..sharkcode<Data/Import.tpp,includes>

For later use we declare a ``Data`` object holding points and a
``LabeledData`` object (aka ``ClassificationDataset``) holding
points augmented with unsigned integer labels. ::

..sharkcode<Data/Import.tpp,datasets>


File Formats
------------

Shark supports a number of standard file formats for data sets, most
prominently comma(character)-separated-values (CSV) for dense data and
the LIBSVM format (http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvm/) for sparse
data. Furthermore, images in PGM format can be read.

Shark does not come with its own data set format any more in order to
avoid further growth of the jungle of data set formats. However, data
can be serialized, which practically amounts to a data file format.

Most data formats in common use are restricted to (sparse)
vectorial input data. Thus, when dealing with non-vectorial data
the user needs to write specialized methods for loading/storing
the data. It is understood that shark cannot implement any
possible data format you can dream of. However, if the input
type is serializable with boost::serialization, then the
:doxy:`Data` container can be serialized.


Generate from Artificial Distributions
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Data sets can be generated using artificial distributions.
Currently, shark comes with a few distributions for testing
purposes, but if you need automatically generated (pseudo
random) data then you probably want to create your own
distribution class. To create your own data distribution,
you have to derive a class from the :doxy:`DataDistribution`
or :doxy:`LabeledDataDistribution` interfaces and overload
the ``draw`` method, which allows shark to draw a examples
from your probability distribution. Also you can choose which
types your inputs and labels should have.

As an example, let us generate inputs from the real line with
labels 0 and 1 with equal probability, with uniform and
overlapping class-conditional distributions: ::

..sharkcode<Data/Import.tpp,distribution>

Once the distribution is defined it is easy to generate a data set: ::

..sharkcode<Data/Import.tpp,generate>


Comma-Separated Values (CSV)
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Shark supports the simplistic but widespread CSV (comma/character
separated value) data format; however, support of this format is
currently quite limited. Not all class label types are supported
and the data must be dense.

Since the separator in the CSV format is left open it needs to be
specified. A comma (",") is a standard choice, but spaces or tabulators
are also common. A comma is used as a default.

Now you can call one of the import routines like this::

..sharkcode<Data/Import.tpp,csv>

The last two arguments define the separator (here a comma) and the
character introducing a comment line. Here they are set to their
default values, which is the comma and the number sign. Exporting
data is needed less frequently. It works similarly, see
:doxy:`exportCSV`.

The third argument of the second call is one of the constants
``FIRST_COLUMN`` or ``LAST_COLUMN``. It indicates that the first
(or last) number of each line acts as a label - and hence is expected
to be an integer. If you want to import regression data then you have
to load data and labels from different csv files and create a
LabeledData object from the two containers::

..sharkcode<Data/Import.tpp,csv-regression>


Sparse Format (e.g., LibSVM)
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Shark can import sparse vectorial data files. This data format is in
widespread use for SVM software packages such as libSVM. It represents
sparse vectorial data augmented with integer class labels or regression
labels in an ASCII-based format.

Similar to the CSV import functions we can call ::

..sharkcode<Data/Import.tpp,libsvm-dense>

Our ``data`` object defined above represents inputs as type ``RealVector``.
Hence the above call imports the data into a dense ``RealVector`` container.
This is only suitable if we know beforehand that the data is not (very) sparse.
For sparse and often high-dimensional data the above approach is not
only inefficient, it can also easily result in a huge waste of memory,
extensive swapping to take place, and even memory allocation failures.
Instead libSVM data should most often be loaded into sparse vector containers ::

..sharkcode<Data/Import.tpp,libsvm-sparse>

For sparse data the actual data dimension can be deduced only if the
highest feature is non-zero for at least one instance. In a setting like
cross-validation or data sub-sampling this is not always the case.
Therefore the data dimension can be provided explicitly to
:doxy:`importSparseData` as a third argument. The optional fourth argument
specifies the default batch size of the container. It should usually be
left at its default.


Downloading Data from Online Resources
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Shark supports downloading data from websites. This is of interest for
quick experimentation, as well as for benchmark studies.

Shark supports HTTP downloads of dense (CSV) and sparse (libSVM) data.
Simply provide the URL to the data file to populate a LabeledData object:

..sharkcode<Data/Import.tpp,download-url>
