Contributing to Shark
=====================

The Shark library is an open-source software project and welcomes
contributions from external developers. For this reason, the following
process for external contributions to the Shark library and for being appointed as a
Shark core developer has been established:

 * Submit your patch to the Shark review board instance at https://nisys.dyndns.biz:8081
   (see the :doc:`development environment tutorial <../tutorials/for_developers/development_environment>` 
   for more information).
 * Select 'SharkCoreDevelopers' as review group.
 * Whenever the core developers issued a "Ship it":
     * Contact any member of the group SharkCoreDevelopers by email,
       noting down your review number and ask him to commit your patch
       to the Shark repository.
     
That's it :-) Whenever an external developer has ten or more patches
shipped with Shark, he/she might apply to become a Shark core
developer at admin@shark-project.sourceforge.net .
