Source code
+++++++++++

* Shark uses and links against parts of the `Boost software libraries <http://www.boost.org>`_.
  The Boost libraries are not shipped with Shark and have to be installed
  independently. The Boost libraries are available under the `Boost software

* Shark relies on `CMake <http://www.cmake.org/>`_ as its build system.
  CMake is not included with Shark, but needs to be installed externally.
  However, CMake configuration files are provided with Shark for convenience.
  CMake is available  under the 3-clause (new/modified) `BSD license
