Using the documentation
=======================

Now that you've successfully installed Shark, you probably
want to do something with it.

There are at least six different entry points to get started:

*  the :doc:`online tutorials <../tutorials/tutorials>`;
*  the C++ example programs shipped with Shark, which can be found

   * in the ``examples/`` subdirectory of your Shark source
     directory, or

   * in ``${INSTALLPATH}/share/shark/examples/`` if you installed a
     binary package (``${INSTALLPATH}`` is most likely to be
     ``/usr/local``);

*  the `Doxygen documentation <../../../../../doxygen_pages/html/annotated.html>`_ generated from the source code;
*  our `YouTube Channel <http://www.youtube.com/user/SharkMLLibrary>`_;
*  the C++ test programs shipped with Shark (in the ``Test/`` subdirectory of your Shark installation); and
*  the source code itself.

The latter two options require that you are not only using pre-compiled binaries,
but actually downloaded a Shark source code package or checked out from SVN.
If you experience any problems, make sure to check the :doc:`FAQ <../faq/faq>`.

We recommend starting with the :doc:`tutorials <../tutorials/tutorials>` to get
an impression of how Shark works. Afterwards, or for the more impatient, look at
those example programs that seem closest to what you want to use
Shark for. If you want to deviate from those examples and exploit
the full power of Shark, you probably won't get around looking at
the Doxygen documentation and the source code itself.
