	//after k iterations will have length gamma^k*||g|| (assuming the trust-region bound is not a problem).
	//thus gamma in a quadratic model is exactly the convergence constant. To obtain superlinear convergence, we have to
	//find a schedule such that gamma ->0. This can be achieved by setting gamma =sqrt(||g||) once the gradient norm is smaller than sqrt(0.5).
	//we choose gamma such that we have linear convergence as long as we are far away from the optimum, (defined as ||g||>=1) 
	//and sqrt(||g||) when we are close. We could use a faster converging schedule, but it is not clear whether this is always good on a 
	//non-quadratic function, even though in the end quadratic convergence is obtained - however getting close enough might take a long time 
	//if we spend too much time on solving the newton steps before we enter this region(which might be extremely small!)
