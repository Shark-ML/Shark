	///\defgroup gradientopt Gradient-based Single objective optimizers
	///\ingroup optimizers
	/// Gradient-Based optimizers use the gradient of an objective function to find a local minimum in the search space.
	/// If a function is not convex this local optimum might not be the global one.
	
	///\defgroup singledirect Single-objective Direct-Search optimizers
	///\ingroup optimizers
	/// Group of optimization algorithms that find the local optimum of a function without using gradient information, only
	/// the function values are used.
	
	///\brief Base class for all single objective optimizer
	///
	/// This class is a spezialization of the AbstractOptimizer itnerface for the class of single objective optimizers. A single objective optimizer is an optimizer
	/// which can only optimize functions with a single objective. This is the default case for most optimisation problems. 
	/// the class requires the ObjectiveFunction to provide a feasible starting point. If this is not possible, a second version of init is provided where the starting point can be 
	/// explicitely defined. 
	/// The Return type of an SingleObjectiveOptimizer is the SingleObjectiveResultSet which is a struct returning the best value of the function and together with it's point.
