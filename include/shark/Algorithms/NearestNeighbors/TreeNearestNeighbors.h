/// \brief Iterative nearest neighbors query.
///
/// \par
/// The IterativeNNQuery class (Iterative Nearest Neighbor
/// Query) allows the nearest neighbors of a reference point
/// to be queried iteratively. Given the reference point, a
/// query is set up that returns the nearest neighbor first,
/// then the second nearest neighbor, and so on.
/// Thus, nearest neighbor queries are treated in an "online"
/// fashion. The algorithm follows the paper (generalized to
/// arbitrary space-partitioning trees):
///
/// \par
/// Strategies for efficient incremental nearest neighbor search.
/// A. J. Broder. Pattern Recognition 23(1/2), pp 171-178, 1990.
///
/// \par
/// The algorithm is based on traversing a BinaryTree that
/// partitions the space into nested cells. The triangle
/// inequality is applied to exclude cells from the search.
/// Furthermore, candidate points are cached in a queue,
/// such that subsequent queries profit from points that
/// could not be excluded this way, but that did not turn
/// out the be the (current) nearest neighbor.
///
/// \par
/// The tree must have a bucket size of one, but leaf nodes
/// with multiple copies of the same point are allowed.
/// This means that the space partitioning must be carried
/// out to the finest possible scale.
///
/// The Data must be sotred in a random access container. This means that elements
/// have O(1) access time. This is crucial for the performance of the tree lookup.
/// When data is stored in a Data<T>, a View should be chosen as template parameter.
