 * \brief       Quadratic programming for Support Vector Machines
 * 
 * 
 * \par
 * This file provides a number of classes representing hugh dense
 * matrices all related to kernel Gram matices of possibly large
 * datasets. These classes share a common interface for
 * (a) providing a matrix entry,
 * (b) swapping two variable indices, and
 * (c) returning the matrix size.
 * 
 * \par
 * This interface is required by the template class CachedMatrix,
 * which provides a cache mechanism for restricted matrix rows, as it
 * is used by various quadratic program solvers within the library.
 * The PrecomputedMatrix provides a sometimes faster but more memory
 * intensive alternative to CachedMatrix.

//! \par
//! For practical considerations the solvers supports
//! several stopping conditions. Usually, the optimization
//! stops if the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) condition for
//! optimality are satisfied up to a certain accuracy.
//! In the case the optimal function value is known a
//! priori it is possible to stop as soon as the objective
//! is above a given threshold. In both cases it is very
//! difficult to predict the runtime. Therefore the
//! solver can stop after a predefined number of
//! iterations or after a predefined time period. In
//! these cases the solution found will not be near
//! optimal. In SVM training, using sensitive settings,
//! this should happen only during model selection while
//! investigating hyperparameters with poor
//! generalization ability.
