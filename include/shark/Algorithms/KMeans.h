/// \brief The kernel k-means clustering algorithm

/// \f$ \{x_1, \dots, x_n\} \f$
/// and splits it into k clusters, based on centroids
/// \f$ \{c_1, \dots, c_k\} \f$.
/// The centroids are elements of the reproducing kernel Hilbert space
/// (RHKS) induced by the kernel function. They are functions, represented
/// as the components of a KernelExpansion object. I.e., given a data point
/// x, the kernel expansion returns a k-dimensional vector f(x), which is
/// the evaluation of the centroid functions on x. The value of the
/// centroid function represents the inner product of the centroid with
/// the kernel-induced feature vector of x (embedding of x into the RKHS).
/// The distance of x from the centroid \f$ c_i \f$ is computes as the
/// kernel-induced distance
/// \f$ \sqrt{ kernel(x, x) + kernel(c_i, c_i) - 2 kernel(x, c_i) } \f$.
/// For the Gaussian kernel (and other normalized kernels) is simplifies to
/// \f$ \sqrt{ 2 - 2 kernel(x, c_i) } \f$. Hence, larger function values
/// indicate smaller distance to the centroid.
///

/// for k-means to work. This is because the current implementation
