/// \brief Implementation of the exact hypervolume subset selection algorithm in 2 dimensions.
///
/// This algorithm solves the problem of selecting a subset of points with largest hypervolume in 2D.
/// The algorithm has complexity n (k+log(n)) 
///
/// While this algorithm accepts fronts with dominated points in it, the caller has to ensure
/// that after domination checks there are at least as many points left as there are to select. The
/// Algorithm will throw an exception otherwise.
///
/// This can easily be ensured by removing the nondominated points prior to calling this function.
///
/// The algorithm is described in:
/// Bringmann, Karl, Tobias Friedrich, and Patrick Klitzke. 
/// "Two-dimensional subset selection for hypervolume and epsilon-indicator."
/// Proceedings of the 2014 conference on Genetic and evolutionary computation. 
/// ACM, 2014.
