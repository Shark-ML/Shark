/// \brief Step size adaptation based on the success of the new population compared to the old
///
/// This is the step size adaptation algorithm as proposed in 
/// Ilya Loshchilov, "A Computationally Efficient Limited Memory CMA-ES for Large Scale Optimization"
///
/// It ranks the old and new population together and checks whether the mean rank of the new population
/// is lower than the old one in this combined population. If this is true, the step size is increased
/// in an exponential fashion. More formally, let \f$ r_t(i) \f$ be the rank of the i-th individual in the 
/// current population in the combined ranking and 	\f$ r_{t-1}(i) \f$ the rank of the i-th previous
/// individual. Then we have
/// \f[ z_t \leftarrow \frac 1 {\lamba^2} \sum_i^{\lambda} r_{t-1}(i) - r_t(i) - z*\f]
/// where \f$ z* \f$ is a target success value, which defaults to 0.25
/// this statistic is stabilised using an exponential average:
/// \f[ s_t \leftarrow (1-c)*s_{t-1} + c*z_t \f]
/// where the learning rate c defaults to 0.3
/// finally we adapt the step size sigma by
/// \f[ \sigma_t = \sigma_{t-1} exp(s_t/d) \f]
/// where the damping factor d defaults to 1
