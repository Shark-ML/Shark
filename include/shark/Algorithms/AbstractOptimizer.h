/// \brief An optimizer that optimizes general objective functions
/// 
/// After construction and configurationg the optimizer, init() is called with the objective function
/// to be used. After that step() can be called until the required solution is found. The solution can be queried
/// using solution(). The type of the solution depends on the optimisation problem at hand.
/// It is allowed to add constrains on the features the objective function needs to offer
/// 
/// These are:
///	- REQUIRES_VALUE: The function is evaluated to use the optimizer and
///	  the HAS_VALUE-flag must be set
///	- REQUIRES_FIRST_DERIVATIVE: The first derivative needs to be evaluated and
///	- HAS_FIRST_DERIVATIVE must be set
///	- REQUIRES_SECOND_DERIVATIVE: The second derivative needs to be evaluated and
///	- HAS_SECOND_DERIVATIVE must be set
///	- CAN_SOLVE_CONSTRAINED: The optimizer can solve functions which are constrained and
///	  where the IS_CONSTRAINED_FEATURE is set.
///	- REQUIRES_CLOSEST_FEASIBLE: If the function is constrained, it must offer a way to
///	construct the closest feasible point and
///	- CAN_PROVIDE_CLOSEST_FEASIBLE must be set
/// 
/// Also when init() is called as offered by the AbstractOptimizer interface, the function
/// is required to have the CAN_PROPOSE_STARTING_POINT flag.
/// 
/// \tparam PointType The type of search space the optimizer works upon.
/// \tparam ResultT The objective space the optimizer works upon.
/// \tparam SolutionTypeT The type of the final solution.
