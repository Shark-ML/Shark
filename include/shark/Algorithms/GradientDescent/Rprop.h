 *  \brief This class offers methods for the usage of the
 *         Resilient-Backpropagation-algorithm with/out weight-backtracking.
 *
 *  The Rprop algorithm is an improvement of the algorithms with adaptive
 *  learning rates, which use increments for the update
 *  of the weights which are independent from the absolute partial
 *  derivatives. This makes sense, because large flat regions
 *  in the search space (plateaus) lead to small absolute partial
 *  derivatives and so the increments are chosen small, but the increments
 *  should be large to skip the plateau. In contrast, the absolute partial
 *  derivatives are very large at the "slopes" of very "narrow canyons",
 *  which leads to large increments that will skip the minimum lying
 *  at the bottom of the canyon, but it would make more sense to
 *  chose small increments to hit the minimum.
 *
 *  So, the Rprop algorithm only uses the signs of the partial derivatives
 *  and not the absolute values to adapt the parameters. <br>
 *  Instead of individual learning rates, it uses the parameter
 *  \f$\Delta_i^{(t)}\f$ for weight \f$w_i,\ i = 1, \dots, n\f$ in
 *  iteration \f$t\f$, where the parameter will be adapted before the
 *  change of the weights: <br>
 *
 *  \f$
 *  \Delta_i^{(t)} = \Bigg\{
 *  \begin{array}{ll}
 *  min( \eta^+ \cdot \Delta_i^{(t-1)}, \Delta_{max} ), & \mbox{if\ }
 *  \frac{\partial E^{(t-1)}}{\partial w_i} \cdot
 *  \frac{\partial E^{(t)}}{\partial w_i} > 0 \\
 *  max( \eta^- \cdot \Delta_i^{(t-1)}, \Delta_{min} ), & \mbox{if\ }
 *  \frac{\partial E^{(t-1)}}{\partial w_i} \cdot
 *  \frac{\partial E^{(t)}}{\partial w_i} < 0 \\
 *  \Delta_i^{(t-1)}, & \mbox{otherwise}
 *  \end{array}
 *  \f$
 *
 *  The parameters \f$\eta^+ > 1\f$ and \f$0 < \eta^- < 1\f$ control
 *  the speed of the adaptation. To stabilize the increments, they are
 *  restricted to the interval \f$[\Delta_{min}, \Delta_{max}]\f$. <br>
 *  After the adaptation of the \f$\Delta_i\f$ the update for the
 *  weights will be calculated as
 *
 *  \f$
 *  \Delta w_i^{(t)} := - \mbox{sign}
 *  \left( \frac{\partial E^{(t)}}{\partial w_i}\right) \cdot \Delta_i^{(t)}
 *  \f$
 *
 * There are several variants of the algorithm depending on what happens
 * when the optimum is overstepped, i.e. a sign change of the gradient occurs
 * and/or the new objective value is larger than the old.
 *
 *  Weight-backtracking can be used to increase the
 *  stability of the method.
 *  if \f$\frac{\partial E^{(t-1)}}{\partial w_i} \cdot
 *  \frac{\partial E^{(t)}}{\partial w_i} < 0\f$ then
 *  \f$\Delta w_i^{(t)} := - \Delta w_i^{(t-1)}\f$.
 *  This heuristic can be improved by further taking the value of the last iteration
 *  into ccount: only undo an updated if the sign changed and the new function value 
 *  is worse than the last. The idea of this modification is, that a change of the sign of the
 *  partial derivation \f$\frac{\partial E}{\partial w_i}\f$
 *  only states, that a minimum was skipped and not, whether this step
 *  lead to an approach to the minimum or not.
 *
 *  Furthermore, it has been shown to be beneficial to use gradient freezing
 *  when the rgadient changes sign, i.e. ,
 *  if \f$\frac{\partial E^{(t-1)}}{\partial w_i} \cdot
 *  \frac{\partial E^{(t)}}{\partial w_i} < 0\f$ then
 *  \f$\frac{\partial E^{(t)}}{\partial w_i} := 0\f$;
 * Thus, after an unsuccessful step is performed, delta is not changed
 * for one iteration.
 *
 * Based on this, 4 major algorithms can be derived:
 * Rprop-: (no backtracking, no freezing)
 * IRprop-: (no backtracking, freezing)
 * Rprop+: (gradient based backtracking, freezing)
 * IRprop+: (function value based backtracking, freezing)
 *
 * By default, IRprop+ is chosen.
