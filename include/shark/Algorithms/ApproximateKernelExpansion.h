/// \brief Approximates a kernel expansion by a smaller one using an optimized basis.
///
/// often, a kernel expansion can be represented much more compactly when the points defining the basis of the kernel
/// expansion are not fixed.  The resulting kernel expansion can be evaluated much quicker than the original
/// when k is small compared to the number of the nonzero elements in the weight vector of the supplied kernel expansion.
///
/// Given a kernel expansion with weight matrix alpha and Basis B of size m, finds a new weight matrix beta and Basis Z with k vectors
/// so that the difference of the resulting decision vectors is small in the RKHS defined by the supplied kernel.
///
/// The algorithm proceeds by first performing a kMeans clustering as a good initialization. This initial guess is then optimized
/// by finding the closest weight vector to the original vector representable by the basis. Using this estimate, the basis
/// can then be optimized.
///
/// The supplied kernel must be dereferentiable wrt its input parameters which excludes all kernels not defined on RealVector
///
/// The algorithms is O(k^3 + k m) in each iteration.
///
/// \param rng the Rng used for the kMeans clustering
/// \param model the kernel expansion to approximate
/// \param k the number of basis vectors to be used by the approximation
/// \param precision target precision of the gradient to be reached during optimization
