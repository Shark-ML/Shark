/// \brief Base class for stopping criteria of optimization algorithms.
///
/// Each stopping criterion provides a stop method which takes as argument
/// the latest result of an optimization algorithm. This result is passed
/// as a ResultSetT, which is a template type of this interface. In actual
/// implementations, that type will usually hold the latest objective
/// function value reached by the optimizer on the training set, but may
/// also additionally encapsulate a performance value reached on a validation
/// set. The stopping criteria may then use this information to reach their
/// characteristic decision of whether or not stopping the optimization
/// process is indicated or not.
///
template<class ResultSetT>
class AbstractStoppingCriterion{
public:
	typedef ResultSetT ResultSet;
	///resets the internal state. call before a new trial
	virtual void reset() = 0;
	///after an iteration, updates the internal state and checks whether the algorithm should stop
	///@param set the result of the current iteration
	virtual bool stop(ResultSet const& set) = 0;
