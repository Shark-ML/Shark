/// \brief SStopping criterion monitoring the quotient of generalization loss and training progress
///
/// The GeneralizationQuotient is, as the name suggests, a quotient of two other stopping criteria,
/// namely the generalization loss and the
///
///
///
///
///


/// This stopping criterion is based on the empirical fact that the generalization error does not have a smooth surface.
/// It is normal that during periods of fast learning the generalization loss might increase first and than decrease again.
/// This class calculates the quotient of training progress and generalization loss. It stops if it is bigger than
/// maxloss > 0.

///
/// Terminology for this and other stopping criteria is taken from (and also see):
///
/// Lutz Prechelt. Early Stopping - but when? In Genevieve B. Orr and
/// Klaus-Robert MÃ¼ller: Neural Networks: Tricks of the Trade, volume
/// 1524 of LNCS, Springer, 1997.
