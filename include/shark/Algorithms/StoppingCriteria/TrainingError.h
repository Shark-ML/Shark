///  \brief This stopping criterion tracks the improvement of the error function of the training error over an interval of iterations.
///
/// If at one point, the difference between the error values of the beginning and the end of the interval are smaller
/// than a certain value, this stopping criterion assumes convergence and stops.
/// Of course, this may be misleading, when the algorithm temporarily gets stuck at a saddle point of the error surface.
/// The functions assumes that the algorithm is minimizing. For details, see:
///
/// Lutz Prechelt. Early Stopping - but when? In Genevieve B. Orr and
/// Klaus-Robert MÃ¼ller: Neural Networks: Tricks of the Trade, volume
/// 1524 of LNCS, Springer, 1997.
