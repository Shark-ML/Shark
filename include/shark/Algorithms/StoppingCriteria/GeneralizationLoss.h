/// \brief The generalization loss calculates the relative increase of the validation error compared to the minimum training error.
///
/// The generalization loss at iteration t is calculated as
/// \f$ GL(t) 100 \left( \frac {E_v(t)} {\min_{t'} E_l(t')}  -1 \right)  \f$
/// where \f$ E_v \f$ is the validation error and \f$ E_l \f$ the training error.
/// This is a good indicator for overfitting, since it measures directly the gap between the two values. This method
/// stops when the generalization error is bigger than some predefined value. The disadvantage is, that
/// when the training error is still changing much a big generalization loss might be repaired later on. So this method
/// might stop to soon.
///
/// Terminology for this and other stopping criteria is taken from (and also see):
///
/// Lutz Prechelt. Early Stopping - but when? In Genevieve B. Orr and
/// Klaus-Robert MÃ¼ller: Neural Networks: Tricks of the Trade, volume
/// 1524 of LNCS, Springer, 1997.
