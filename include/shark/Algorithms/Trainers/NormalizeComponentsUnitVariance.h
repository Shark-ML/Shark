/// \brief Train a linear model to normalize the components of a dataset to unit variance, and optionally to zero mean.
///
/// \par
/// Normalizing the components of a dataset works via
/// training a Normalizer model. This model is then
/// applied to the dataset in order to perform the
/// normalization. The same model can be applied to
/// different datasets.
///
/// \par
/// The typical use case is that the Normalizer
/// model is trained on the training data. Later, as
/// "test" data comes in, the same model is used, of
/// course without being recalibrated. Thus, the model
/// used for normalization must be independent of the
/// dataset it was trained on.
///
/// \par
/// Note that subtracting the mean destroys sparsity.
/// Therefore this feature is turned off by default.
/// If you have non-sparse data and you need to
/// move data to zero mean, not only to unit variance,
/// then enable the flag zeroMean in the constructor.
