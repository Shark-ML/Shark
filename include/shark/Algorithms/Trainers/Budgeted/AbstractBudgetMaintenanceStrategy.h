/// \brief This is the abstract interface for any budget maintenance strategy.
///
/// To allow for easy exchange of budget maintenance strategies, each of
/// them should derive from this class. The only function it defines is addToModel,
/// which, when implemented, will add a given supportvector and given alphas
/// to the provided model by applying the respective budget maintenance strategy.
/// (Note that not all merging strategies need the alphas, but some do)

	/// coefficient, then obviously this is the smallest element. in this case we
	/// just proceed as usual. the caller must decide what to do with such a vector.
	/// \par note: The model is not allowed to be empty and an exception is thrown in this case.
