/// \brief Represents the Shape of an input or output
///
/// Mostly used for vector data, the Shape describes
/// The expected structure of a model. 
/// A N-D shape with shape variables (n1,n2,..nN)
/// expects an input of size n1*n2*...*nN which is then interpreted as tensor
/// with the dimensionalities n1 x n2 x ... x nN. 
/// A batch of inputs is then treated as each element having this shape, so
/// the batch size is not a part of the shape.
///
/// The standard shape
/// is the 1-D shape just describing that a model interprets every
/// input as 1-D input.
/// A 0-D shape describes the inputs of a model where the input can not be
/// described by a shape, for example a class label or other scalar values are 0d shapes.
/// A 3-D shape could describe an image patch with rows x columns x channels.
///
/// Shapes can be flattened, this way a 3-D image patch can also be treated as a simple
/// vector input.
///
/// Shark currently does not enforce Shapes, it only checks that input data is compatible
/// to a shape, i.e. a vector has the right number of dimensions.
