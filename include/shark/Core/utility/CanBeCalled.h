	///\brief detects whether Functor(Argument) can be called.
	///
	///Suppose you have a general Functor. It might take several arguments,
	///some more suited for your computation than others. In this case one may
	///want to check, which input argument may work.
	///The exact implementation and inner workings are outlined in
	///http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_52_0/doc/html/proto/appendices.html
	///the trick is to generate a functor F2 from our supplied functor, such that
	/// F2(arg) is always a valid expression, but at the same time F2(arg) and F(arg)
	/// have clearly distinguishable return types. There are a few tricks needed for the
	/// case that F(arg) has return type void.
