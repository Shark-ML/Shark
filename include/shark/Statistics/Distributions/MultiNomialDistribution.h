/// \brief Implements a multinomial distribution.
///
/// A multinomial distribution is a discrete distribution with states 0,...,N-1
/// and probabilities p_i for state i with sum_i p_i = 1. This implementation uses
/// the fast alias method (Kronmal and Peterson,1979) to draw the numbers in 
/// constant time. Setup is O(N) and also quite fast. It is advisable 
/// to use this method to draw many numbers in succession.
///
/// The idea of the alias method is to pair a state with high probability with a state with low
/// probability. A high probability state can in this case be included in several pairs. To draw,
/// first one of the states is selected and afterwards a coin toss decides which element of the pair 
/// is taken.
