///\brief Base class for all Models.
///
/// \par
/// A model is one of the three fundaments of supervised learning: model, error measure
/// and an optimization algorithm.
/// It is a concept of a function which performs a mapping \f$ x \rightarrow f_w(x)\f$.
/// In contrast to an error function it has two sets of parameters:
/// The first is the current point to map \f$x\f$, the others are the internal model parameters \f$w\f$
/// which define the mapping.
/// Often a model is used to find an optimal mapping for a problem, for example a function which
/// best fits the points of a given dataset. Therefore, AbstractModel does not only offer
/// the mapping itself, but also a set of special derivatives with respect to \f$ x \f$ and \f$ w \f$.
/// Most of the time, only the derivative with respect to \f$ w \f$ is needed, but in some special problems,
/// like finding optimal stimuli or stacking models, also the input derivative is needed.
///
///\par Models are optimized for batch processing. This means, that instead of only one data point at a time, it can
/// evaluate a big set of inputs at the same time, using optimized routines for this task.
///
/// \par
/// The derivatives are weighted, which means that the derivatives of every single output are added together
/// weighted by coefficients (see #weightedParameterDerivative). This is an optimization for the chain rule
/// which is very efficient to calculate most of the time.
///
/// \par
/// It is allowed to store intermediate values during #eval and use them to speed up calculation of
/// derivatives. Therefore it must be guaranteed that eval() is called before calculating derivatives.
/// This is no restriction, since typical error measures need the mapping itself and not only the derivative.
///
/// \par
/// Models have names and can be serialised and have parameters. The type of the parameter vector
/// can be set as third argument. By default, this is RealVector.
