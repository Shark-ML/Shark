/// \brief Weighted sum of kernel functions
///
/// For a set of positive definite kernels \f$ k_1, \dots, k_n \f$
/// with positive coeffitients \f$ w_1, \dots, w_n \f$ the sum
/// \f[ \tilde k(x_1, x_2) := \sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i \cdot k_i(x_1, x_2) \f]
/// is again a positive definite kernel function. This still holds when
/// the sub-kernels only operate of a subset of features, that is, when
/// we have a direct sum kernel ( see e.g. the UCSC Technical Report UCSC-CRL-99-10:
/// Convolution Kernels on Discrete Structures by David Haussler ).
///
/// This class is very similar to the #WeightedSumKernel , except that it assumes
/// its inputs to be tuples of values \f$ x=(x_1,\dots, x_n) \f$. It calculates
/// the direct sum of kernels
/// \f[ \tilde k(x, y) := \sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i \cdot k_i(x_i, y_i) \f]
///
/// Internally, the weights are represented as \f$ w_i = \exp(\xi_i) \f$
/// to allow for unconstrained optimization.
///
/// The result of the kernel evaluation is devided by the sum of the
/// kernel weights, so that in total, this amounts to fixing the sum
/// of the of the weights to one.
///
/// In the current implementation, we expect the InputType to be a
/// boost::fusion::vector. For example, boost::fusion::vector<RealVector,RealVector>
/// represents a tuple of two vectors.
