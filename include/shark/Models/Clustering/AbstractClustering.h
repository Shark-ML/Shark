/// \brief Base class for clustering.
///
/// \par
/// Clustering algorithms vary widely in the data structures
/// on which they operate. For example, simple centroid-based
/// approaches such as k-means are mutually incompatible with
/// tree-based hierarchical clustering. This interface class
/// is the attempt to cast different cluster descriptions into
/// a minimal common interface that is useful for prediction.
///
/// \par
/// There are at least two common types of predictions made
/// with clusterings. The first one is the assignment of the
/// best matching cluster to a patters, such as in vector
/// quantization or unsupervised clustering. This is often
/// referred to as "hard clustering". The second one is the
/// computation of a membership function ("soft clustering").
/// The membership of a pattern to a cluster is non-negative,
/// and the total membership should add to one.
///
/// \par
/// This interface makes minimal assumptions to allow for
/// these types of predictions. It assumes that clusters can
/// be enumbered (identified by an index), and that at least
/// a membership test can be made (hard clustering). It is
/// optional to provide a membership function. Only one of
/// the two interfaces for best matching cluster or membership
/// function need to be implemented, since the best matching
/// cluster can be deduced from the membership function.
/// However, often the best matching cluster can be computed
/// more efficiently than the membership function. In these
/// cases both interface functions should be implemented.
///
/// \par
/// The purpose of this interface is to act as a common
/// super class to different data structures describing the
/// outcome of a clustering operation. The interface allows
/// all of these data structures to be used in the two
/// clustering model classes: HardClusteringModel and
/// SoftClusteringModel.
