/// \brief Hinge-loss for large margin regression using th squared two-norm
///
/// The loss is defined as \f$L_i = 1/2 \max\{0.0, ||f(x_i)-y{i,j}||^2- \epsilon^2\} \f$  
/// where \f$ y_i =(y_{i,1},\dots,y_{i_N} \f$ is the label of dimension N
/// and \f$ f_j(x_i) \f$ is the j-th output of the prediction of the model for the ith input. 
/// The loss introduces the concept of a margin to regression, that is, points are not punished
/// when they are sufficiently close to the function.
///
/// epsilon describes the distance from the label to the margin that is allowed until the point leaves
/// the margin.
///
/// Contrary to th EpsilonHingeLoss, this loss is differentiable.
